# Uranium - analytics web application

Uranium is a web application that allows the management of interventions and the management of tools in the controlled activity zones of the nuclear sector.

This is a school project, and I completed it with three classmates. Each of us was responsible for different parts, and I was mainly responsible for the coding of the entire web app.
